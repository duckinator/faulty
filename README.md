# Faulty

A game about a robot who just wants to go home.

## Building

For Manjaro Linux, and probably other ArchLinux-based distros:

```
$ sudo pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-gcc sdl2
```

(mingw-w64-gcc is for creating Windows builds.)

Requires:

* GNU Make
* GCC
* SDL 2
* GCC cross-compiler setup, if you're building for Windows from Linux
